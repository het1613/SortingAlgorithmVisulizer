# Sorting Algorithm Visulizer
Learn a variety of sorting algorithms by visually seeing data bars of different sizes being sorted

# Introduction
This visulizer I programmed using Python demonstrates the 8 most common sorting algorithms (such as bubble, merge, quick, etc.). I also implemented sliders for sorting speed and min/max data values to better see how bars of different height are being sorted in ascending order. The program also features a user-friendly GUI using Python Tkinter that students can use to learn about sorting algorithms. I taught other students how to buid a similar visulizer as part of my lessons during my time as President of my school's Computer Science Club.

# Requirements
- Any version of Python
- All 8 sorting algorithms and the main Python file in the SAME DIRECTORY
- Execute the main Python file only to run the visulizer
